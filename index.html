                            UofSC students need a way to upload all of their documents to the same place and receive confirmation that it has been received.

                            My groupmates and I created a diagram to show our problem statement's accessibility, design, function, and organization.
                            We showed the different ways it helps USC students and makes it easy to use.

                            My groupmates and I created different personas that could benefit the other users and the people we made.
                            This persona chart or graph shows the personas' wants, criteria, fears, values, and needs.

                            My groupmates and I created a storyboard to visually show how the program can help users of different ages and a computer's skill level.
                            The storyboard outlines and shows the user's needs and wants and how they are met through the website.

                            My groupmates and I drew out the individual screens on how the applications look. This visual representation helps the user get a visible description of how the application works.

                            In this video and presentation, I convey how the app or website DOCU would work. I showed how it's a simple login and two-step verification process.
                            I also show the home and different windows involved.

                        <p> 
                            I came up with a scenario based on how to use the application and the different task that comes along with it.
